task2: "Goto (3,8) with yaw 90"
program2: |
  ```
  goto 0.0,5.0,0;
  # If I told you Target endpoint (5.000, 0.000) is occupied (obstacle detected).
  # You can repair the code by decreasing the target distance slightly, for example, try moving 0.05 units in y-axis each time.
  # Updated example: 
  goto 0.0, 4.97, 0.0;
