Tried to allocate 1.45 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 6.00 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 17179869184.00 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 20.06 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 49.00 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)\nEnsure your environment has a compatible CUDA-enabled torch, and that any required libs for quantized models (autoawq/awq) are installed."
